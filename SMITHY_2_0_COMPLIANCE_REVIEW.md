# Smithy 2.0 Specification Compliance Review

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: June 17, 2025  
**Implementation Status**: In Development with Error Recovery

This document tracks the compliance status of the Smithy C# Code Generator against the official [Smithy 2.0 specification](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/).

## Executive Summary

**Overall Compliance**: ~35% (Improved from previous ~25%)

**Recent Progress**:
- ✅ Enhanced error recovery and diagnostics implementation
- ✅ Improved parsing reliability for complex scenarios
- ✅ Better CLI integration with detailed error reporting
- 🔄 Foundation laid for advanced parsing architecture

**Critical Gaps**: Parser architecture limitations prevent full specification compliance. Token-based parsing recommended for achieving >80% compliance.
