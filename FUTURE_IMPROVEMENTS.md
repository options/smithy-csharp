# Future Improvements

This document outlines planned improvements and feature additions for the Smithy C# Code Generator project. These items are organized by priority and may be implemented in future releases.

## High Priority

### Parser Improvements

1. **Multi-line Parser Enhancement** âœ“ IMPLEMENTED
   - Improve parsing of complex multi-line blocks in Smithy IDL
   - Support nested structure definitions with proper indentation handling
   - Added proper balance checking for nested parentheses and braces
   - Enhanced parsing of trait properties with complex values

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Enhance error reporting with line numbers and suggested fixes
   - Implement partial model generation even with non-critical errors

3. **JSON AST Parser Completion**
   - Complete the implementation of Smithy JSON AST format parsing
   - Support all Smithy 2.0 features in JSON format

### Core Type System

1. **Complete Type Constraint Implementation**
   - Add support for all constraint traits in the Smithy 2.0 specification
   - Implement proper validation for complex type constraints

2. **Recursive Shape Validation**
   - Add validation for recursive shape definitions
   - Prevent infinite recursion during code generation

3. **Collection Member Shape IDs**
   - Generate proper member shape IDs for List, Map, and Set types

## Medium Priority

### Protocol Support

1. **HTTP Protocol Traits**
   - Complete implementation of HTTP binding traits
   - Add support for REST APIs with proper routing

2. **Service Properties**
   - Add support for all service properties defined in Smithy 2.0
   - Implement version, errors, and rename properties

3. **Streaming Operations**
   - Enhance streaming support with proper C# implementations
   - Add support for bidirectional streaming operations

### C# Generation Improvements

1. **Modern C# Features**
   - Use latest C# language features (nullable reference types, records, pattern matching)
   - Generate code compatible with .NET Standard 2.0, .NET 6+

2. **ASP.NET Core Integration**
   - Generate controllers and middleware for easy ASP.NET Core integration
   - Support minimal API style endpoints for operations

3. **Documentation Generation**
   - Enhanced XML documentation from Smithy comments
   - Support for additional documentation traits

## Low Priority

### Advanced Features

1. **Mixin Support**
   - Implement Smithy mixin trait handling
   - Generate proper inheritance for mixed-in shapes

2. **Selector Support**
   - Add support for Smithy selector expressions
   - Generate selector-based conditional code

3. **Advanced API Patterns**
   - Support for pagination
   - Support for waiters
   - Support for resource-based operations

### Developer Experience

1. **Visual Studio Extension**
   - Create a Visual Studio extension for Smithy IDL editing
   - Add code generation from within Visual Studio

2. **MSBuild Integration**
   - Create MSBuild tasks for Smithy code generation
   - Add source generator support for compile-time generation

3. **CLI Enhancements**
   - Add more command-line options for customization
   - Support for project configuration files

## Contribution Opportunities

These areas are great starting points for new contributors:

1. Adding support for specific constraint traits
2. Implementing additional unit tests
3. Documentation improvements
4. Example projects showcasing the generator
5. Performance optimizations for large models
