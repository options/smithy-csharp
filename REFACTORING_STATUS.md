# Refactoring Summary

## Completed

1. **Refactoring of Generator Classes**:
   - Extracted constraint attribute generation to `ConstraintAttributeGenerator.cs`
   - Extracted HTTP protocol generation logic to `HttpProtocolGenerator.cs`
   - Created specialized generators for:
     - `ServiceGenerator.cs`: Handles service shape code generation
     - `StructureGenerator.cs`: Handles structure shape code generation 
     - `ResourceGenerator.cs`: Handles resource shape code generation
   - Created a new non-static `TypeMapper` class for better integration

2. **New Code Generator Implementation**:
   - Created `CSharpCodeGeneratorV2.cs` as a clean implementation using the new generator classes
   - Updated CLI to use the new generator implementation
   - Fixed compatibility issues with model classes

3. **GitHub Configuration**:
   - Created comprehensive README.md with project overview, features, usage examples
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD
     - `build.yml`: Builds and tests the project on every push and PR
     - `release.yml`: Creates releases and publishes NuGet packages for tagged versions
   - Added LICENSE file (MIT)
   - Added CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for contributors
   - Created CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md using Contributor Covenant
   - Added issue templates for bug reports and feature requests

## Still To Do

1. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Add code examples for more complex use cases
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Add setup guides for different environments

2. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for the new generator classes
   - Create integration tests with sample Smithy files
   - Test compatibility with complex real-world models

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Profile the generator with large Smithy models
   - Optimize memory usage for large-scale code generation

## Notes

The project has been significantly improved with a clean, modular architecture. The separation of concerns makes the codebase more maintainable and extendable. The new implementation should make it easier to add support for additional Smithy 2.0 features in the future.

All essential GitHub configuration is complete, and the project is ready for open source publication.

### Migration Plan

To migrate existing code to use the new implementation:

1. Replace uses of `CSharpCodeGenerator` with `CSharpCodeGeneratorV2`
2. Update any custom extensions to work with the new generator class structure
3. Run tests to ensure compatibility
